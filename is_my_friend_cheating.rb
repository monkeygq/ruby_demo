# A friend of mine takes a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (where n > 0).
# Within that sequence, he chooses two numbers, a and b.
# He says that the product of a and b should be equal to the sum of all numbers in the sequence, excluding a and b.
# Given a number n, could you tell me the numbers he excluded from the sequence?
# The function takes the parameter: n (don't worry, n is always strictly greater than 0 and small enough so we shouldn't
#  have overflow) and returns an array of the form:

# [(a, b), ...] or [[a, b], ...] or {{a, b}, ...} or or [{a, b}, ...]
# with all (a, b) which are the possible removed numbers in the sequence 1 to n.

# [(a, b), ...] or [[a, b], ...] or {{a, b}, ...} or ...will be sorted in increasing order of the "a".

# It happens that there are several possible (a, b). The function returns an empty array if no possible numbers are found 
# which will prove that my friend has not told the truth!

# Examples:

# removNb(26) should return [(15, 21), (21, 15)]
# removNb(100) should return []

#========================================================================================================>
#
# combination is not a good solution, O(n ** 2) 
# below is O(n)
# a * b = sum(n) - a - b
# a = sum(n) - b / b + 1
# then determine a's scope
# when b = n , a is min , so a >= sum(n) - n / n + 1
# when b = a , a is max , so a <= sqrt(sum(n) + 1) - 1
# then sum(n) - n / n + 1 <= a <= sqrt(sum(n) + 1) - 1
# so, b is calculated also (a and b must to_i)
# if a * b + a + b = sum(n)
# [a,b] and [b,a] are results
# finally sort
