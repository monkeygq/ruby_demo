# This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some # examples:
#
# seven(times(five)) # must return 35
# four(plus(nine)) # must return 13
# eight(minus(three)) # must return 5
# six(divided_by(two)) # must return 3
# Requirements:
#
# There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
# There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy # (divided_by in Ruby)
#
# Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
# The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand


class Object
  %w(zero one two three four five six seven eight nine).each_with_index do |num, index|
    define_method(num) { |args=nil| args ? index.send(*args): index.to_f }
  end 
  %w(plus + minus - times * divided_by /).each_slice(2) do |method, symbol|
    define_method(method) { |args| [symbol, args] }
  end 
end


p two(plus(eight)) # => 10

# invoke sequence : eight , plus(8) , two(["+", 8])
